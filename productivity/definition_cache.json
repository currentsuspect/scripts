Exit, or as they sometimes call themselves Horde of Irritated People, the acronym being HIP, has a hierarchal social ladder similar to that of the fellow gang, the Bloods. However unlike many other African andLatin gangs, Exit treats their sluts with the utmost respect and tolerance. Whereas other such gangs would rape and molest women they found attractive, Exit gives their sluts the choice of how they would like to exemplify theirsluttynessand if they refuse then they are forced by penalty of watergun firing squad to hookup with an Exit member behind the cabin.Exit's motto is \"when we come, wecome hard\""
